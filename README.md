# IOT-Internship

```
The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors,
processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices
and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
IOT involves connecting the hardware to the internet. During the internship period , we where
asked to work on hardware components â€“ microcontrollers and push the data of controller to the cloud.
A typical IoT system works through the real-time collection and exchange of data.
